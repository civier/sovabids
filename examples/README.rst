Here we show some exemplary use cases for sovabids.

These examples assume the folder structure of the sovabids repository (ie having the "examples" directory).
If you plan to run these examples you should install sovabids in the following way:

Installation for using examples
-------------------------------

To be able to run all examples the easiest is to install sovabids in the 'advanced-usage' mode,
this helps to preserve that folder structure of the repository and install any additional dependencies needed for the examples.

See the `introduction section of the docs <https://sovabids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#installation-for-advanced-usage>`_ for the installation instructions.
