# For this lemon dataset we dont need session,acquisition nor run. The task is constant for all subjects (resting). 
# Now, the subject key holds the label of the subject. Since this varies from subject to subject we won't set that value as general. 
# How we will do it then? you may ask... Well, we will infer that from the filename in the non-bids object. 
# So in the end we will just set the task information in the entities object.
